This plugin allows you to have a lot of tags variety in your server as you can create tags with ease using this plugin. Besides tags it allows you to make the console execute commands so it can do basically anything. The first tag that I added was a Magnata tag for the player who has spent more money on the server. (Using tebex API). Your can see in the image that the console is sending commands every 3 seconds after checking if there is a new Magnata.

# Important
Make sure you have your server secret key from tebex and write it in the file ServerSecretKey.txt
